This is Machine Learning Algorithm based project of K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm .
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

Here in this project , applying KNN algo on Diabetes Data set.
